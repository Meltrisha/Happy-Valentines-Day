        <p>You truly are an angel and a blessing. I love you so much. Since first meeting you, I have never stopped thinking about you. I think about you and those big brown eyes that remind me of a pool of chocolate so warm and sweet, how your smile enchants me everyday and makes it possible to look forward to the day. Your laugh and how it is intoxicating and how it's music to my ears. I wish I could have you on replay every single day. Your love is truly more than I could ever ask for. Thank you so much for letting me be a part of your life. I love you, sweet baby angel of mine!! - Sincerly, Yours Aways Melissa.<3</p>
